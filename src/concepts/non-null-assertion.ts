// In TypeScript, the non-null assertion operator is a postfix expression operator that can be used when the operand preceding it is not null and not undefined. 
//It's written as an exclamation mark ! following the operand.

// Here's an example:
let variable: string | null = "Hello, world!";
let nonNullVariable: string = variable!;  // Non-null assertion operator

//In this example, variable is of type string | null, which means it could be a string or null. However, the nonNullVariable is of type string, which 
// means it can't be null. The non-null assertion operator ! is used to tell TypeScript that variable is not null or undefined at this point,
// so it's safe to assign it to nonNullVariable.

// The non-null assertion operator doesn't change the runtime behavior of your code; it's purely a compile-time construct used to improve type-checking.

// It's important to use the non-null assertion operator judiciously. Overuse can lead to runtime errors if you assert that a variable is non-null when 
// it can actually be null or undefined. It's generally better to use TypeScript's strict null checks and handle potential null or undefined values explicitly.
